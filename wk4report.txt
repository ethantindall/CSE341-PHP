After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Provide a link to your myDb.sql file at GitHub (the file that contains all the SQL commands needed to create your database).

https://github.com/roguejuan44/CSE341-PHP/blob/master/db/myDb.sql

2. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.

I like how the foreign keys came together. It has been a while since I've practiced SQL and it was fun relearning how the tables interact.

3. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.

I had to deviate from my original plan some. Last week I submitted a database diagram including tables for clients and users. However, since I would actually like to use this at my work I thought I should remove those tables to keep that information private. I replaced them with the support_staff and storageLocations tables. I do think that the database would benefit from having a client table though.

4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

I was surprised to learn about PSQL. I know about MySQL and the other variations, but I'd never heard about PSQL so it was interesting to learn about how it works.

5. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.

Reduce redundancy: This can be done through using foreign keys to avoid having multiple versions of the same data.
Table Organization: Group similar data on the same table and dissimilar data on different tables.

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
1 - Some attempt was made
2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
4 - Meets requirements
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

5

7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

Began populating the tables with useful data.
